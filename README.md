# PostgresResearch

This software package represents what I worked on with the SEFCOM group (Fuzztainer project) at ASU-Tempe.  In it you will find scripts which:

* Automatically pull from a master list thousands of postgres targets to retrieve environment variables and Postgresql.conf settings
* Create csv files with all the data collected from the aforementioned script
* Build docker images with modified environment variables/configuration settings
* Python process manager to keep the Fuzztainer/AFL sessions alive
* and more

Most of the scripts should have an explanation or be self explanatory
